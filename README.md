# Submission Management Backend Server

Welcome to the Submission Management Backend Server! This server is designed to handle API calls from the frontend for saving and retrieving submissions seamlessly. Built with Express and TypeScript, it provides a robust backend infrastructure for your application.

Overview
The backend server serves as the backbone for your submission management system. It offers three essential endpoints: /ping, /submit, and /read, each fulfilling specific functionalities to support your application's needs.

Endpoints
/ping (GET):
This endpoint always returns a response of "True," indicating that the server is up and running.

/submit (POST):
Use this endpoint to submit new form entries. It accepts parameters such as "name," "email," "phone," "github_link," and "stopwatch_time" in the request body.

/read (GET):
Use this endpoint to retrieve saved form submissions. It requires a query parameter "index," which represents the 0-index for reading the (index+1)th form submission.

Getting Started
To set up and run the backend server locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install Node.js if not already installed.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Run npm install to install the dependencies.
Create a JSON file named "db.json" to serve as the database for storing submissions.
Run npm start to start the server.
Additional Features
While the backend server covers the essential functionalities outlined above, you can enhance its capabilities with additional features such as:

Deletion of Submitted Forms: Implement a feature to delete specific form submissions.
Editing Submitted Forms: Allow users to edit existing form entries for updates or corrections.
Searching Forms by Email ID: Add a search functionality to retrieve form submissions based on email IDs.
